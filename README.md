# Linear-Regression-With-Tesla-Stocks
This project demonstrates the implementation of linear regression to predict Tesla stock prices. 

Given data on date, open price, highest price, lowest price, closing price, adjusted price and volume. 

I use the standard approach to linear regression, including data preparation, model training, and estimation of the coefficient of determination (RÂ²).

# Linear Regression in Jupyter Notebook 
For a detailed description of linear regression, please open the file [linear_regression.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/LilPoly/Linear-Regression-With-Tesla-Stocks/blob/main/linear_regression.ipynb). 
Now, let's briefly talk about the most important things.
